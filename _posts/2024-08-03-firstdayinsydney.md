My first tour in the centre of Sydney was great. The buildings are beautiful and impressive. The landscape and the view from Manly is beautiful.

I went looking for whales in the middle of the whale season. Unfortunately I didn't spot any, but I was able to recognise dolphins.

In Tombalong Park, I watched the public viewing of the 2024 Olympics and listened to good live music.

From the area known as The Rocks, the skyscrapers come into their own at night.

After a short tour around the Opera House, I was able to see it from the outside on the ferry.
